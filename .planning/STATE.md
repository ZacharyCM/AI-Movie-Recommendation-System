## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 23 requirements following sequential dependency chain
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (RAG) flagged for deep research before implementation
- [Roadmap]: Mood-based discovery merged into Phase 6 (UI & Discovery) rather than standalone phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (RAG) is highest-risk, highest-value. Research-phase recommended before implementation to address prompt engineering, hallucination prevention, and caching strategies.
- Phase 4 fusion layer weighting may need experimentation. No exact formula established yet.
